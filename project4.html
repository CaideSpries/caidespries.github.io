            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 2rem auto;">
                <p>Digital filters are essential for cleaning up sensor data, processing audio, and enhancing images.
                    But on resource-constrained microcontrollers, not all filters are practical. This project conducts a
                    head-to-head comparison of three fundamental digital filter types to determine the best choice for
                    real-time applications on the popular ESP32-CAM board.</p>

                <p>We implemented and tested three distinct low-pass filters:</p>
                <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
                    <li><strong>Finite Impulse Response (FIR):</strong> A stable, convolution-based filter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infinite Impulse Response (IIR):</strong> A computationally efficient filter using a
                        feedback loop.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):</strong> A frequency-domain based filter.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The core objective was to measure their real-world performance by analysing computation time, signal
                    delay, and data loss, ultimately identifying the optimal filter for embedded systems.</p>

            <h2>The Contenders: Filter Design and Characteristics</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>Each filter was designed in MATLAB to have the same cutoff frequency, but their underlying structures
                    lead to very different characteristics. The FIR filter's performance is a trade-off based on the
                    number of samples in its impulse response, while the IIR filter's performance is tied to its 'order'
                    (the number of poles).</p>

            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 2rem auto;">
                <p>To verify that the filters worked as expected, we challenged each with a square wave input. An ideal
                    low-pass filter should remove the high-frequency harmonics of the square wave, converting it into a
                    smooth sine wave. The plots below show a visual comparison of how each filter type performed.</p>

                <p>Visually, the FIR and IIR filters produce a relatively smooth sine wave, while the DFT filter's
                    output appears distorted and noisy. This qualitative result already suggests significant performance
                    differences, which we then quantified.</p>

                <p>While the FIR and IIR filters appeared effective, quantitative analysis of their performance revealed
                    a clear winner for real-time use. We measured the computation overhead of each filter, represented
                    as 'samples lost per 100 samples.' The results were stark.</p>

                <p>The results were conclusive:</p>
                <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
                    <li><strong>The IIR Filter</strong> was the top performer, with a nearly negligible sample loss
                        (less than 5 samples per 100) and the lowest time delay. Its per-sample processing makes it
                        predictable and highly efficient.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The FIR Filter</strong> offered a reasonable trade-off, with low sample loss (~2 samples
                        per 100) but a significant time delay that grew with its buffer size, making it less suitable
                        for real-time applications.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The DFT Filter</strong> was unequivocally the worst choice. It was computationally
                        intensive, leading to an extremely high time delay and a catastrophic loss of samples (over
                        7,000 samples lost per 100 with a buffer of 100), making it completely unusable for this
                        application.

            <h2>Conclusion: The Verdict</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 2rem auto;">
                <p>For real-time filtering on a resource-constrained platform like the ESP32, the IIR filter is the
                    clear and superior choice. It provides the best combination of low time delay, minimal data loss,
                    and predictable performance, making it ideal for live audio, sensor, or image processing.</p>

                <p>While the FIR filter is functional, its performance is fundamentally tied to a trade-off between
                    filter quality and time delay, making it a compromised second choice. The DFT-based approach,
                    despite its theoretical power, proved to be completely impractical due to its immense computational
                    overhead and poor performance with finite buffers. This project provides a practical guide for
                    selecting the right filter to achieve reliable, real-time signal processing on embedded
                    hardware.</p>
