        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project investigates the implementation of three different types of filters on an ESP32 Cam board to determine which performs best on floating point hardware: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) filters. The study aims to enhance signal quality and data accuracy in various real-time applications.</p>

        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p>The project involves the following tasks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Designing FIR, IIR, and DFT filters using MATLAB and implementing them on an ESP32 Cam board.</li>
          <li>Testing the filters with real-time signal inputs to evaluate their performance.</li>
          <li>Measuring and comparing the computational efficiency and accuracy of each filter type.</li>
          <li>Analysing the results to determine the most suitable filter for specific real-time applications.</li>
        </ol>

      <section id="project-results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The project concluded that the IIR filter performs best in terms of time delay and computational efficiency, making it ideal for real-time filtering applications. The FIR filter showed a trade-off between time delay and filter accuracy, while the DFT filter was found to be the least suitable for real-time applications due to its high computational complexity and poor performance.</p>
