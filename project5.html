                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project focuses on improving data storage and transmission for camera traps used in monitoring wildlife, specifically focusing on Marshall Eagles in the Kruger National Park. It addresses challenges such as data loss, power efficiency, and the need for continuous monitoring in harsh environmental conditions.</p>

                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>The system design includes capturing high-resolution images at regular intervals, detecting motion to reduce 'dead' periods, and storing data on a microSD card with timestamps. The temperature and humidity data are also recorded and stored. A wireless transmission system ensures that data can be collected without the need to climb trees, enhancing the safety and efficiency of the research process.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Design and integrate a low-power image capturing and storage system.</li>
                    <li>Implement a motion detection system to optimise data collection periods.</li>
                    <li>Incorporate a temperature and humidity monitoring system.</li>
                    <li>Ensure reliable wireless data transmission to a base station.</li>
                    <li>Validate the system through rigorous testing and refinement.</li>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The redesigned camera trap system successfully addressed the client's challenges, providing a reliable and efficient method for monitoring raptor nests. The system's ability to store and transmit data wirelessly minimised the need for physical retrieval, reducing the risk of data loss and improving overall research efficiency.</p>
