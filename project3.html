                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project outlines the requirements and design procedures for the compression and encryption of data received by the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) onboard the SHARC buoy in Antarctica. The goal is to compress data to reduce transmission costs and encrypt it for secure transmission.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The system successfully compressed and encrypted data from the IMU, achieving a compression ratio of at least 1.5 and encryption times within the acceptable range. The implementation of the Twofish and LZSS algorithms was efficient, and the data transmission via Iridium was secure and cost-effective.</p>
