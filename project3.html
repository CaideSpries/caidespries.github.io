            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>This project involved designing and implementing a critical data processing system for the SHARC
                    (Sea-ice, Heat, and Atmosphere Research Cabled) buoy, a scientific instrument deployed to study
                    pancake ice in Antarctica. Operating in a remote, power-constrained environment, the system's
                    primary challenge is to collect sensor data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), process it
                    efficiently, and transmit it securely over an exceptionally costly Iridium satellite link.</p>

                <p>Our solution is an embedded system pipeline built on an ARM-based STM32 microcontroller that performs
                    three key tasks:</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Compression:</strong> To dramatically reduce satellite transmission costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> To ensure the confidentiality of the scientific data.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Integrity Check:</strong> To guarantee the data received by researchers is identical to
                    what was collected.

            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>The system is designed as a sequential data pipeline, where raw sensor data is processed through
                    several key submodules before transmission. Each stage must be computationally inexpensive and
                    memory-efficient to operate on the resource-constrained STM32 board. The entire process, from data
                    collection to transmission, is designed to be robust and autonomous.</p>

            <h2>Technology Stack and Algorithm Selection</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>Selecting the right technologies was critical to meeting the project's strict power and processing
                    constraints.</p>

                <p><strong>Hardware:</strong> The core of the system is the STM32F051 Discovery Board, featuring a
                    low-power ARM Cortex-M0 processor. For sensor data, we used a SparkFun 9DoF IMU (ICM-20948), which
                    closely mimics the sensor planned for the final buoy.</p>

                <p><strong>Compression Algorithm:</strong> We chose the LZSS algorithm. Our research showed it offered a
                    great balance of high compression ratio, speed, and low computational complexity, making it ideal
                    for this embedded application.</p>

                <p><strong>Encryption Algorithm:</strong> After initial testing, we implemented a custom modified
                    Blowfish algorithm. The popular Twofish algorithm proved too resource-intensive for the STM32's
                    hardware, so we pivoted to its predecessor, which was designed for hardware efficiency and provided
                    robust security.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>We conducted extensive testing to validate both the functionality and performance of the entire data
                    pipeline. The system was benchmarked for compression ratio, processing speed, and correctness across
                    various data sizes and conditions.</p>

                <h3>Complete Pipeline Validation</h3>
                <p>To validate the entire data pipeline, we conducted end-to-end tests that processed sample IMU data
                    through compression, encryption, simulated transmission, decryption, and finally decompression. The
                    final checksum verification confirmed that data integrity was maintained throughout the entire
                    process, as shown in the output below:</p>

            </div>

            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto; margin-top: 2rem;">
                <p>Our results demonstrate a highly efficient system. The compression algorithm consistently achieved an
                    average compression ratio of over 15:1, a crucial factor for reducing satellite costs. As shown in
                    the graphs, both the compression and encryption algorithms operate at high speeds (averaging ~950
                    bytes/second and ~910 bytes/second respectively), well within the performance requirements for the
                    buoy's sampling rate.</p>

                <p>We also tested the system's robustness by introducing under-sampling, high-frequency sampling, and
                    Gaussian noise, with the pipeline continuing to perform reliably under all tested conditions.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>This project resulted in a successful, end-to-end data processing pipeline for a real-world
                    scientific instrument. We met the primary objective of creating a system that could compress and
                    encrypt sensor data efficiently on a low-power microcontroller.</p>

                <p>A key learning experience was the practical challenge of implementation on embedded hardware. Our
                    initial choices of Twofish and LZMA, while theoretically sound, were unsuited for the STM32's
                    architecture. By successfully pivoting to a modified Blowfish and the LZSS algorithm, we were able
                    to meet all user requirements and deliver a robust, working system. The project is a testament to
                    the importance of balancing theoretical performance with the practical constraints of hardware in
                    embedded systems design.</p>
