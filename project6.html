                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This study investigates the use of microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of plastics for hydrogen production, with a focus on microplasmas and hotspot identification within microwave cavities. Using two microwave technologies, an inverter and a transformer microwave, the study explores how energy distribution influences the efficiency and reproducibility of hydrogen production. The research involves thermal mapping experiments to identify energy hotspots, and hydrogen production tests using an FeAl2O3 catalyst under various conditions.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The study demonstrated that placing the FeAl2O3 catalyst in identified microwave hotspots significantly enhanced hydrogen production, particularly in initial tests with the inverter microwave. This supports the hypothesis that hotspot placement improves the efficiency of microwave-assisted hydrogen production. However, successive tests showed a decline in hydrogen yield, attributed to catalyst exhaustion.
                    Tests with the transformer microwave produced no hydrogen, likely due to the depleted catalyst rather than differences in microwave technology. Equipment constraints, including glassware failure at higher power levels, and limited catalyst availability hindered further comparisons of inverter and transformer microwave performance.
                    The findings emphasise the need for fresh catalyst material to maintain consistent hydrogen yields. They also highlight opportunities for future research, including catalyst regeneration methods, enhanced temperature measurement techniques, and improving material durability for high-temperature microwave reactions. Investigating the role of microplasmas as a heating mechanism remains a critical area for further exploration.</p>
