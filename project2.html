            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>Hashing algorithms are fundamental to data integrity and security, but not all are created equal.
                    This project explores the critical trade-offs between the classic, sequential MD5 algorithm and the
                    modern, parallel-by-design MD6 algorithm. We conducted a comparative analysis by implementing these
                    hashes across three distinct platforms:</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard Software (C++):</strong> To establish a performance baseline.</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware Acceleration (Verilog on an FPGA):</strong> To test the limits of raw speed
                    with dedicated hardware.
                </li>
                <li><strong>GPU Parallel Computing (OpenCL):</strong> To investigate how a parallel framework
                    handles both sequential and parallel-native algorithms.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>The core objective was to quantify the performance differences in execution time and throughput,
                    revealing the optimal use case for each approach.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Algorithms: MD5 vs. MD6</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>The key difference between the two algorithms lies in their structure. MD5 processes data in a
                    strictly
                    sequential order, where each step depends on the previous one. This makes it inherently difficult to
                    parallelise. The MD6 algorithm, in contrast, was designed with a tree-like structure that allows
                    large
                    files to be broken down and hashed concurrently, making it ideal for modern multi-core processors
                    and
                    parallel environments.</p>

            <h2>Methodology: Implementations Across Platforms</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>To perform a comprehensive comparison, we developed several implementations:</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C++ (MD5 & MD6):</strong> Served as our "golden standard" for software performance. We
                    created both sequential and parallel (multi-threaded) versions of MD6 to directly measure the
                    benefits of parallelization in software.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Verilog (MD5):</strong> A hardware implementation designed for a Nexys A7 FPGA. The goal was
                    to offload the entire hashing computation to a dedicated chip to achieve the lowest possible
                    execution time.
                </li>
                <li><strong>OpenCL (MD5):</strong> A GPU-based implementation to test whether the massively parallel
                    architecture of a GPU could overcome the sequential nature of the MD5 algorithm.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results and Performance Analysis</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>Our experiments, which tested files of various sizes, revealed significant performance differences
                    across the implementations. The two graphs below summarise the overall comparison of execution time
                    and throughput for the software-based approaches.</p>
            </div>

            <figure style="text-align: center;">

            </figure>

                     alt="Line graph comparing throughput in MB/s across different implementations including C++ MD5, C++ MD6, Parallel MD6, and OpenCL MD5"

                <figcaption>Figure 3: Comparison of Throughput Across Implementations</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>As the graphs clearly show, the parallelised C++ MD6 implementation is the undisputed winner for
                    handling large data volumes. It consistently demonstrates the lowest execution time and the highest
                    throughput, reaching nearly 500 MB/s. This directly confirms the architectural advantages of a
                    parallel-aware algorithm.</p>

                <h3>Key Performance Highlights</h3>

                <p>Digging deeper into the data reveals two fascinating edge cases:</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Power of Dedicated Hardware:</strong> For very small messages (0 bytes), the Verilog
                    FPGA implementation was astonishingly fast, achieving a speedup of over 132x compared to the
                    standard C++ MD5. Its execution time was a mere 8.88 nanoseconds. This highlights the incredible
                    efficiency of hardware acceleration for highly specific, repetitive tasks, even though its input
                    size was limited.
                </li>
                <li><strong>An Insightful Failure:</strong> The OpenCL implementation of MD5 was significantly slower
                    than the basic C++ version. This is a critical finding: applying a parallel framework to an
                    inherently sequential algorithm does not guarantee a speedup. The overhead of transferring data to
                    the GPU and managing the kernel outweighed any potential benefits, proving that the algorithm's
                    design is paramount.

                    for both MD5 and MD6.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center; max-width: 90%; margin: 1rem auto;">
                <p>This project successfully quantified the trade-offs between software, GPU, and hardware
                    implementations of sequential and parallel hashing algorithms. The key findings are clear:</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>For high-throughput applications on modern systems, the parallelised MD6 algorithm is the superior
                    choice.
                </li>
                <li>For specialised, low-latency tasks with small inputs, a hardware (FPGA) implementation offers
                    unparalleled speed.
                </li>
                <li>A parallel architecture like a GPU cannot fix a fundamentally sequential algorithm like MD5; in
                    fact, the overhead can make performance worse.
